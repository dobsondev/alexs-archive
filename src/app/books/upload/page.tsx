          <ol className="list-decimal mt-1 mb-4 px-8">
            <li>Go to the book page on Goodreads</li>
            <li>Look at the URL, which will be in the format: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/[ID]-[title]</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mt-1">
            For example, we want to use the filename <span className="font-semibold underline">61431922-fourth-wing.epub</span> for &quot;Fourth Wing&quot; which can be found here:
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1 px-4">
            &bull; <a className="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing" target="_blank">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing</a>
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            As you can see, we extracted the file name of <span className="font-semibold underline">61431922-fourth-wing.epub</span> from the URL above. 
            You may also see extra text and letters after the ID, usually prefixed with a <span className="font-semibold underline">?</span>. 
            That could look something like this:
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1 px-4">
            &bull; <span className="font-semibold underline">.../61431922-fourth-wing?ac=1&from_search=true</span>
          </p>
          <p className="mt-1">
            All of that should be ignored and not included in the file name.
